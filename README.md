# DLADA
A deep-learning based workflow for subsurface data assimilation and prediction

The repo presents a history matching and prediction workflow based on Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA). Deep learning based surrogate models are built to accelerate the workflow. Detailed algorithm can be found in the preprint:
